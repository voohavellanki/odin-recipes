            <li>1.75 cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>.5 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temp</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, .25 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Mix together butter and 1.5 cups sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in egg and vanilla until incorporated. Add apple butter and mix until combined. Pour in .5 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Add remaining dry ingredients and mix just until no dry clumps of flour remain. Cover bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Mix together remaining .25 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon in a shallow bowl or pie pan. Drop tablespoon-sized pieces of dough into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and roll into balls, coating well. Place 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
